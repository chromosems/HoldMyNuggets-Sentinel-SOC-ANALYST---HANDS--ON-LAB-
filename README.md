# ATTACK AND DETECT

## Objective
This lab exercise teaches how to detect credential theft attempts using LimaCharlie EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response). The learning objective is to understand how attackers use techniques like LSASS memory dumping to steal credentials, and then learn to craft detection rules to identify such malicious activities. Students will gain hands-on experience by first performing the attack using a Sliver C2 session, then analyzing the telemetry in LimaCharlie, and finally creating and testing a detection rule that successfully alerts on this behavior.
